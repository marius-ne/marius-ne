Hello! I’m Marius, a student in Aerospace Engineering. 
I obtained a Double Degree from RWTH Aachen in Germany and École Centrale de Lille in France. Currently I am doing a 6 month internship at the European Space Agency, at their ESTEC establishment in the Netherlands. Here I work on Vision Based Navigation for autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control of Spacecraft. This can be applied to Rendezvous and Landing scenarios.

Feel free to reach out.
