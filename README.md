Hello! I’m Marius Neuhalfen, a student in Aerospace Engineering.🚀 
I am studying for a Double Master's Degree from RWTH Aachen in Germany and École Centrale de Lille in France. I speak German, French and English. 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇬🇧

I have recently completed a 6 month internship at the European Space Agency, ESTEC. There I worked on Vision Based Navigation for autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control of Spacecraft. I developed a new way of performing real time validation of the image processing involved by using view synthesis to render novel views with an existing dataset. In addition, I introduced a new analytical measure of the difficulty of a pose for pose estimation tasks.

Feel free to reach out!😃
